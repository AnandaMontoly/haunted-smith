Read me.  Documentation of the Final Project for Savitha Ravi and Ananda Montoly.
The user must have the images in the same directory as the file.  They must also have graphics, getpass, time, random, and pygame modules installed.  Otherwise, the program can't run.  This is because all of those modules have key parts to play in the running of the code.

Description:  This program doesn't have the story completely finished, but it's an interactive text adventure.  It features the ability to be inside of a room, move to a different room, talk to people, pick up objects, combine objects into different objects, use objects as keys, give objects to people, and generally enjoy the story.  Books have been coded but have yet to exist inside of the game universe.  Because I'm lazy, tbh.  The program also has music and it can end, but the endings only work in classic mode which the game isn't in.  You can also look at objects, though those aren't implemented in the game yet because I am lazy yet again.  The main paradigms of the game are object oriented and functional programming.

Modules:
Time, getpass, and random are pre-installed with python.
Pygame - https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
Graphics - http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py

Known bugs:
Not sure.  We need some new eyes.
