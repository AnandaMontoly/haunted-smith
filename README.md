Read me.  Documentation of the Final Project for Savitha Ravi and Ananda Montoly.
Project Name: Spooky Smith
The user must have the images and music in the same directory as the file. They must also download the minigame files hangman and decoder as well. These are located in the zip file provided. They must also have graphics, getpass, time, random, and pygame modules installed.  Otherwise, the program can't run.  This is because all of those modules have key parts to play in the running of the code.

Description:  This program doesn't have the story completely finished, but it's an interactive text adventure.  It features the ability to be inside of a room, look at a room, move to a different room, talk to people, pick up objects, combine objects into different objects, use objects as keys, give objects to people, and generally enjoy the story.  Books have been coded but have yet to exist inside of the game universe. The program also has music, minigames, and it can end. The main paradigms of the game are object oriented and functional programming. Written for Introduction to Computer Science at Smith College.

Modules:
Time, getpass, webbrowser, and random are pre-installed with python.
