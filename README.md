# haunted-smith
beginning of text based adventure about smith being haunted
this is the basic code behind which the system for a text based adventure can work.
It allows the user to move through rooms with names and descriptions and read a series of commands
these commands are things like moving to different rooms, picking up objects, using those objects as keys, talking to NPCS, and giving those NPCS objects
this can be used to travel through more rooms.  Ending system is rudimentary but a basic one is also implemented.
